# 🏨 Hotel Management System (DBMS Project)

A database-driven Hotel Management System built using **SQL, DBMS concepts, ER modeling, PL/SQL procedures, triggers, and relational constraints**.  
This project simulates real hotel operations such as **room booking, billing, staff management, payments, and guest record handling**.

## 📌 Features

✔ Room booking and cancellation  
✔ Guest and staff management  
✔ Automated room allocation  
✔ Billing and payment tracking  
✔ Validation rules for secure and error-free data  
✔ Transaction-based query execution  
✔ Stored procedures for repetitive operations

## 🧠 Database Design

The system is designed using a fully normalized relational schema to ensure:

- Data integrity  
- Reduced redundancy  
- Consistency across tables  

### ER Diagram

Includes entities such as:
- **Hotel**
- **Rooms**
- **Room Types**
- **Booking**
- **Payment**
- **Staff**
- **Guest Details**

> The ER-to-table mapping follows proper normalization and relationship modeling (1:1, 1:N, N:M).
